2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

Port output_addr[4] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[4]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#133 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port output_addr[5] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[5]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#134 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port output_addr[6] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[6]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#135 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port output_addr[7] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[7]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#136 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port output_addr[8] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[8]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#137 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port output_addr[9] does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal output_addr[9]. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-3#1 Warning
Out of context clock terminal  
Clock port ap_clk does not have an associated HD.CLK_SRC property. Without this constraint, timing analysis may not be accurate for signal ap_clk and upstream checks cannot be done to ensure correct clock placement.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
