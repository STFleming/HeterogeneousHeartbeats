@W [HLS-40] Cannot find source file src/hhb_query_top.cpp; skipping it.
@I [HLS-10] Validating synthesis directives ...
@W [HLS-40] Directive 'RESOURCE' for core 'AXI4LiteS' cannot be applied: There are multiple assignments to variable 'status' in 'hhb_query'. The resource directive is just applied to the first assignment currently. If this is not intended, please use a unique variable name or introduce a new scope so the assignment can be uniquely located.

@I [RTGEN-500] Setting interface mode on port 'hhb_query/current_heartbeat' to 'ap_none' (register).
@W [RTGEN-101] Port 'current_heartbeat' with mode 'ap_none' may require an associated data valid signal to correctly communicate with other blocks or a test bench; automatic C/RTL co-simulation may not be able to verify such a port.
