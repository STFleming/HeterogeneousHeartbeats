# TODO list for the HHB framework


* First things first, organise the code base a little bit

* Applications are registered onto the application list on startup, (don't worry about removing them from the list for now)
	The Heatbeaet initialisation function will manage this, it will search through the list and add the application to the end
* Add pragmas so indicate if the hhb_query module is in use
* Create an initialisation routine that sets up the application list and also spins up management threads for hardware tasks that are registering heartbeats
